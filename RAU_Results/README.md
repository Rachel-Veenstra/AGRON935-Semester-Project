# Sample Datasets

In this folder, find final datasheets produced by the RAU_Calc code. These files will contain four columns - Sample ID, nitrate concentration (micromoles/gram), ureide concentration (micromoles/gram), and final RAU calculations. It doesnt matter how many different samples are passed through the code, because data is sorted and matched based on the ID information.
