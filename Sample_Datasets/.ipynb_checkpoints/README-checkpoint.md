# Sample Datasets

In this folder, find datasheets for running with RAU_Calc code. Sheets must be in this format with the same four columns. This system is important to follow and is being implemented in our lab to accomodate other data screening and analysis codes.


To run additional files, save them in this folder before running the code.
